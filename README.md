# Project 1: Linked Lists

This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of a templated linked list in C++. The project showcases fundamental operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and search within a linked list data structure, making it an excellent resource for understanding and experimenting with linked lists in practice.

## Features

- Templated linked list implementation allowing for storage of any data type.
- Support for basic linked list operations including:
  - Adding elements to the head and tail.
  - Inserting elements after or before a given node, and at specific positions.
  - Removing elements by value, position, head, and tail.
  - Searching for elements by value.
  - Traversing and printing the list both iteratively and recursively.
- Demonstrations of each functionality through comprehensive test cases.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project is built with C++, so you'll need a C++ compiler to compile and run the project. The project was developed using Visual Studio, which provides an integrated development environment, but you can use any C++ compiler.

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine to get started:

```
git clone https://github.com/DenseLink/Project-1-Linked-Lists.git
```
Open the project in your preferred C++ development environment, compile, and run.

### Usage
The main functionality of the linked list is demonstrated through various test functions in main.cpp. To see the linked list in action, compile and run the main.cpp file. You can modify these tests or add new ones to explore the linked list operations further.

### Contributing
Contributions to improve the project are welcome. Please follow these steps to contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature).
3. Commit your changes (git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature').
4. Push to the branch (git push origin feature/AmazingFeature).
5. Open a pull request.
